rom-tools-and-workflows tutorials
========

The ROM tools and workflows Python library comprises a set of algorithms for
constructing and exploiting ROMs. The library is designed internally in terms of
Protocols and abstract base classes that encapsulate all the information needed
to run a given algorithm. The philosophy is that, for any given application, the
user simply needs to create a class that meets the required API of the abstract base class. 
Once this class is complete, the user gains access to all of our existing algorithms.



This site provides a suite of tutorials and demos on how to the rom-tools-and-workflows package. We provide tutorials for

* Basis construction
* Parameter spaces
* Workflows



.. Important::
    
    rom-tools-and-workflows is only responsible for the offline and workflow aspects of model reduction. It does not deal with the construction of ROMs.
